# Tensorflow-MNIST

This is a warm up project for using tensorflow to best some of the tensorflow features for heads up in Tensorflow 

# TODO
<del>1. Create working network</del>
2. Create proper graph and visualization using tensorboard features
3. Save and restore session for the graph
4. Freeze particular cnn layer and train the model with partial frozen model
