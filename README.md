# Tensorflow-MNIST

This is a warm up project for using tensorflow to best some of the tensorflow features for heads up in Tensorflow 

# TODO
1. Create working network
2. Create proper graph and visualization using tensorboard features
3. Save and restore session for the graph
4. Freeze particular cnn layer and train the model with partial frozen model
